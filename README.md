This repository contains the code and data for the [Impresso](https://impresso-project.ch) project's starter pack. The starter pack is a collection of tools and resources to help you get started with the Impresso data. It includes a set of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to access and analyze the data, as well as a set of Python scripts that can be used to download the data and prepare it for analysis.
